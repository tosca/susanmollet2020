                    <p class="paragraph">Susan Mollet employs five works in her exhibition in the Forum Gallery at Brookhaven College, June 6 - August 4, 2014. All elicit an elegiac tone that extends beyond the particularity of individual, private, loss to a broader engagement of the question of what remains of love after the loss of the beloved. Beginning in the circumstances of loss and of personal memories of what was once presence, the works give form to absence, in a terrible and poignant beauty.

I was especially drawn to the ones depicting her life before kids...before she was mom. The images are digital decals, made from the original pictures, fired onto porcelain. Boxes are made of stoneware.</p>

            <p class="p-2">The Japanese term "yonobi" refers to a balance between beauty and functionality, to find beauty and spirit through the usage of common objects in our daily encounters.
                 I'm increasingly interested in exploring that balance of beauty, curiosity, and functionality, as seen through this work.

                     <p> Sometimes life affords you an extraordinary experience that enriches you and your
                        perspective in ways that unfold. Turkey on a Fulbright study grant. The making of these pieces gave me
                        a chance to reminisce, reflect, and relive the time I spent in a country
                        I came to love and respect for its diverse landscapes, extraordinary natural beauty,
                        rich history and welcoming people.

                    <p>To say that I have tried to recreate places or times is not exactly true. Many of
                        the forms are intuitively made and may simply reference a site or an event, a mood
                        or a feeling that is apparent only to me. Some of the text I have incorporated is
                        taken from a collective journal written by the group, each person chronicling two
                        or more days of the journey. Most pieces reference the abundant ancient stone ruins,
                        stone walls, mysterious mounds not yet excavated, and rugged landscape. But all
                        are a grasp at making permanent that which is an incredible memory for me. From
                        this country of extreme contrasts I came away with textures, colors, forms, friends
                        and images that will always stay in my mind.

                    <p class="p-5">Susan Mollet's installation Happy Birthday consists of 169 ceramic boxes arrayed
                        around the gallery walls. The boxes are small; none are more than three inches in their
                        longest dimension. Glazed an intense lime yellow-green with a red overglaze of
                        geometric and text elements, the boxes continue Mollet’s incorporation of textuality into
                        ceramic objects, while differently deploying the form of the ceramic object as signifier.
                        __ written by David Newman, Gallery Director<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">
                        Mounted on the gallery walls, the boxes are in the physical space of the gallery, their three-dimensionality emphasized by the shadows they cast on the wall. This physicality matters; it is a co-presence with the viewer. The boxes are in three staggered rows centered at the artist’s eyelevel, with additional boxes placed well above and below eyelevel. The boxes are open on the top, their hollowness declared by the die-cut paper packing material filling and emerging from them. In the physical space of the gallery, the boxes are present but in wrapping around the space, are not all-at-once present in simultaneous availability to the viewer’s perception. In not being simultaneously available to perception, the perception of the boxes qua objects, like their surfaces and the glaze pattern and text applied to the surfaces, requires a temporal duration for reception.
                        Reception is of what is given, of what is presented. Presents, perhaps especially birthday presents, are always personal, and thus are essentially private, some thing presented by one person to another. We place the present in a box, packed carefully and wrapped festively, to denote its specialness as a gift. Multiplying a box for a present qua object 169 times, and arraying these objects around the gallery walls, shifts the inherently private act of gift-giving to the public domain. The texts incorporated by overglazing onto the objects are likewise shifters from the personal to the public domain, signifiers of a content that is contextual. Within the public domain, the individual subsists as a locus instantiating the political. This is evident in the work on scrutiny of the dark blood-red glazed texts referencing stem cells, and their application in the treatment of cancer. Marking and celbrating the artist’s brother’s fight against cancer, the title of the installation, Happy Birthday, from the hospital’s reference to the day of his stem cell transplant as his “new birthday.” The work, and particularly the texts glazed onto the surfaces of the boxes, engages the field of discourses surrounding stem cell research, and is thus positioned at the liminal zone between the individual and private, the public and political. Indeed, simply in its installation within the gallery, the work has transited this liminality to enter the political, as do all artworks on being presented. The inference that all artworks are political, engage such fields of discourse and occasions of conversation as they may, follows from this.  That also is not a small present.

                    <p class="pt-5"> Even as a kid I collected objects, always enjoying the variations on one theme, mostly with rocks and leaves then. 
                        But the idea for this series began as I was observing my own collection of old oil cans. I noticed their quiet and understated
                        sense of beauty and economy of line and form. I became aware of the spouts and bodies
                        as line against volume and variety within unity. There were figural implications
                        as well as interplay of forms and negative and positive space. Then I found myself
                        referencing these to a time in my life that was much more quiet and simple, as they
                        were.

                    <p>Inspired by retirement, I have begun to revisit the medium of metal for some of
                        my artwork. I work with silver, steel, copper, and aluminum and continue to bring
                        the idea of everyday objects into my pieces.
